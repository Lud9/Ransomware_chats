Now, Bluff 1 shows our cumulative net income for the year at $3.5M as of August 2022 (Cumulative means from January to Today), the prior month\u2019s income rolls forward and we actually lost money in August. Bluff 2 shows the cumulative year-to-date income as of August which is included in our $3.5M earnings to date and not a separate income number as you incorrectly assessed. All our Financials can be found in the Accounting Drive, Board Reports folder by year and month. The balance sheet and income statement in the folder provides the financial picture. While you review these documents, please delay posting our information to your blog which will harm our negotiations.  After you have read the documents, can we conclude our business.
